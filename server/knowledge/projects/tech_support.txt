**AI Technical Support Agent for Elevator Engineering** *Built at SmartTalks.ai*

Developed an intelligent technical support agent for elevator electrical engineers and technicians, providing instant access to complex technical documentation across 1000+ multimedia files including PDFs, videos, images, and CSVs.

**Core Capabilities:**

* Specialized conversational AI for technical troubleshooting and procedural guidance  
* Multi-format document processing and retrieval (PDFs, videos, images, CSVs, technical manuals)  
* Technical instruction generation for electrical board manipulation and elevator component maintenance  
* Context-aware responses using current date/time and technician work context  
* Automated conversation summarization dynamically injected into system prompts, enabling seamless context retention across multiple sessions  
* Multilanguage support for international client engagement

**Advanced RAG Architecture:**

* **Two-tier intelligent retrieval system:**  
  * Automatic file processing pipeline with cloud folder synchronization (detects additions, modifications, deletions)  
  * Automated document summarization and indexing upon file updates  
  * Similarity search engine retrieving top 3 most relevant documents  
  * AI decision agent evaluating and selecting optimal documents for context  
  * Source attribution with direct quotes and file references in responses  
* Standard RAG system for FAQs and general elevator system knowledge

**Technical Intelligence:**

* Multi-agent orchestration: routing agent → thinking agent → response generation  
* File attachment capabilities delivering source documents alongside instructions  
* Complex technical query handling with step-by-step procedural guidance

**Support & Escalation:**

* Escalation protocol to senior technical staff or human support when needed  
* Comprehensive data storage (conversation logs, summarized history, document queries, tool calls, system errors, CSAT scores, resolution states)

**Business Intelligence:**

* Analytics dashboard tracking usage metrics, costs, technician satisfaction, query types, and resolution rates  
* Error logging and learning flags to identify opportunities for improving agent prompts, document indexing, and retrieval accuracy  
* Document usage analytics identifying gaps in technical documentation

**Technology Stack:**

* Frontend: Vue.js  
* Backend: Node.js, JavaScript  
* Database: MongoDB

**Impact:** Sophisticated technical knowledge management system combining multi-modal document processing, intelligent retrieval orchestration, and multi-agent architecture to provide instant, accurate technical support for field engineers within the SmartTalks.ai ecosystem.
